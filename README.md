<h2>House Price Prediction Model</h2>
This project aims to develop a prediction model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Tree regressor algorithms to predict the price of a house. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to houses such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, location, etc.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project is provided and contains information about different houses. Each house is represented by a set of features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, location, etc., along with the corresponding house prices. It is important to note that the dataset may contain missing values that need to be handled during the data preparation phase.

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
Before building the prediction model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed to handle missing values and perform feature engineering. The following techniques were applied to prepare the data for modeling:

Missing Value Imputation: Missing values in the dataset were handled using appropriate techniques such as mean imputation or using a regression model to predict missing values based on other features.

Feature Scaling: Feature scaling is an important step in many machine learning algorithms. It ensures that all features are on a similar scale, preventing some features from dominating others. Techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Standardization were applied to scale the features.

Normalization: Normalization is used to rescale the features to a range between 0 and 1. It is particularly useful when dealing with features that have different scales and units.

<h2>Model Building</h2>
Three different regression algorithms were implemented to predict house prices: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Tree regressor. These algorithms were chosen due to their effectiveness in handling complex datasets and providing accurate predictions.

Random Forest Regressor: The Random Forest algorithm builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to obtain the final prediction. It is known for its robustness against overfitting and ability to capture complex relationships between features and the target variable. In this project, the Random Forest Regressor achieved the best R2 score of 0.80, indicating a good fit to the data.

XGBoost: XGBoost is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting. It creates a strong predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple weak models (decision trees). XGBoost is popular for its speed and high performance on various datasets.

Extra Tree Regressor: The Extra Tree regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. It differs from Random Forest in that it selects random thresholds for each feature, resulting in more randomness and reducing overfitting. This algorithm is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
The performance of each model was evaluated using the R2 score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features. The Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest R2 score of 0.80, indicating that it was the most effective model for predicting house prices in this project.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, this project developed a prediction model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Tree regressor algorithms to predict the price of a house based on various features. The Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance with an R2 score of 0.80, indicating its effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between the features and the target variable.
